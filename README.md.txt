# Deploy Logic App with Secured storage account with Private Endpoints

At present, we don't have the liberty to use secured storage accounts for standard Logic App deployment. However, you can work with ARM templates which lets you use the Storage account behind firewall for Logic App standard resource deployment

You can refer to the templates upload in teplates folder.

This template has been created from the sample Function App template available here https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.web/function-app-storage-private-endpoints

Disclaimer: The templates provided are samples , you may verify and make changes as per your requiremenrts. Any concerns or queries feel free ot let me know.
